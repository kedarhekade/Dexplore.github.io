                <big>What is Finance?</big> <br>Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. Specifically, it deals with the questions of how an individual,

  company or government acquires money – called capital in the context of a business – and how they spend or invest that money. Finance is then often split into the following 

  major categories: corporate finance, personal finance and public <br>

At the same time, and correspondingly, finance is about the overall "system" i.e., the financial markets that allow the flow of money, via investments and other financial
instruments, between and within these areas; this "flow" is facilitated by the financial services sector. Finance therefore refers to the study of the securities markets, 
including derivatives, and the institutions that serve as intermediaries to those markets, thus enabling the flow of money through the economy.

                    <h2>Who Should Impart Financial Awareness?</h2>
                    <p> Financial knowledge should be imparted to the students from a young age. At home, parents and families 
                        must allow their children to learn about it by providing them with opportunities to earn their pocket
                         money, by helping in household chores etc. Further, schools should take steps to incorporate this important 
                         life skill as a part of their curriculum. Activities at schools should be so designed in a manner that all 
                         students irrespective of the stream of study (commerce, science or humanities) chosen by the them, should be 
                         aware enough to take sound financial decisions and be able to manage their own finances in the long-run.

<h4 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.5em;">* What is Cyber Security?</h4>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;"><b>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. ... Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats.
</b></p>
<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.5em;">* Why is Cyber Security Important?</h2>

<p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;"><b>
With an increasing number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise, combined with the increased deluge of data -- much of which is sensitive or confidential -- the importance of cybersecurity continues to grow. The growing volume and sophistication of cyber attackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.
</b><br><br><h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.5em;">How Attacks Are Launched?</h2>

<p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;"><b>
Cybercriminals launch their attacks using one or more computers to strike other computers, networks or information systems.
<br>
A variety of methods can be used to launch a cyber attack, but the goals is commonly to:
<br>
<br>Steal data
<br><br>Destroy information or data
<br><br>Change data
<br><br>Disable computers
<br><br>Achieve financial gain
<br><br>Espionage</b></p>
<br>
<br>

<h4 style="color:rgb(107, 208, 213);font-size:1.5em;">* Most important topics of cyber security</h4>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>1. Secure Passwords:</b>
<br>*Be at least 8 characters long.
<br>*Use a combination of upper and lower case letters, symbols and numbers.  Substituting letters for numbers (e.g. 3 for E or 1 for I) is however a well-known practice and should be avoided.
<br>*Very long and complex passwords are often viewed as being the strongest, but this is often not the case in practice.  Such passwords are hard to remember and this can lead to people using coping mechanisms (such as writing passwords down or using the same password multiple times) which, ironically, make them more vulnerable to cyber criminals.
</p><p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>2.Malware:</b>
Malware is short for "malicious software." It is a program or file designed to be disruptive, invasive and harmful to your computer. Types of malware include viruses, spyware, adware and worms. ... Virus software is identifiable by its actions and many tools are in place to combat this threat to your computer.
</p><p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>3.Data Privacy:</b>
Cybersecurity refers to the measures taken to protect a computer or computer system against unauthorized access from a hacker. On its most basic level, data privacy is a consumer's understanding of their rights as to how their personal information is collected, used, stored and shared.
</p><p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>4.safe computing:</b>
The main methods you can use to keep your computer safe are to have up to date antivirus and firewall programs, back up your data, use the Internet safely, protect your data by using secure connections and protecting sensitive data, and keep your computer and information safe by using strong passwords and controlling
</p><p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>5.Data breach:</b>
A data breach is an incident where information is stolen or taken from a system without the knowledge or authorization of the system's owner. ... Stolen data may involve sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information such as credit card numbers, customer data, trade secrets, or matters of national security.
</p><p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>6.online scam:</b>
The main purpose of these types of scams can range from credit card theft, capturing user login and password credentials and even identity theft. The top online scam today is Phishing. Internet thieves prey on unsuspecting users by sending out phishing emails
</p><p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size:1.2em;align-content:right;">
<br><b>7.mobile protection:</b>
There are just as many threats on the mobile landscape as there are with computers. With the popularity of smartphones and tablets on the rise, they are becoming more of a target to cybercriminals. Since we are starting to use our smaller devices as we would a desktop or laptop computer, more of our personal data is stored on these devices and thieves are taking notice.

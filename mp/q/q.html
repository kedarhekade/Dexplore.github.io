                <big>Quantum physics</big> is the study of matter and energy at its most fundamental level. A central tenet of quantum physics 
                is that energy comes in indivisible packets called quanta. Quanta behave very differently to macroscopic matter:
                particles can behave like waves, and waves behave as though they are particles.

                    <h1>How did Quantum Physics start ?!! </h1>
                    <p>German physicist Max Planck publishes his groundbreaking study of the effect of radiation on a
                        “blackbody” substance, and the quantum theory of modern physics is born.<br>
                        Through physical experiments, Planck demonstrated that energy, in certain situations, 
                        can exhibit characteristics of physical matter. According to theories of classical physics, 
                        energy is solely a continuous wave-like phenomenon, independent of the characteristics of physical 
                        matter. Planck’s theory held that radiant energy is made up of particle-like components, known as 
                        “quanta.” The theory helped to resolve previously unexplained natural phenomena such as the behavior 
                        of heat in solids and the nature of light absorption on an atomic level. In 1918, Planck was rewarded 
                        the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on blackbody radiation.<br>
                        Other scientists, such as Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Erwin Schrodinger 
                        and Paul M. Dirac, advanced Planck’s theory and made possible the development of quantum mechanics–a
                        mathematical application of the quantum theory that maintains that energy is both matter and a wave, 
                        depending on certain variables. Quantum mechanics thus takes a probabilistic view of nature, 
                        sharply contrasting with classical mechanics, in which all precise properties of objects are, 
                        in principle, calculable. Today, the combination of quantum mechanics with Einstein’s theory of 
                        relativity is the basis of modern physics.

                        Quantum statistical mechanics is statistical mechanics applied to quantum mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics a 
                        statistical ensemble (probability distribution over possible quantum states) is described by a density operator S, which 
                        is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-class operator of trace 1 on the Hilbert space H describing the quantum system. 
                        This can be shown under various mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics. One such formalism is provided by quantum logic

                        At the level of macroscopic phenomena, the quantum statistics of particles determines major aspects of the 
                        behavior of the matter they form. Roughly speaking, identical bosons like to occupy the same quantum-mechanical state.

                        is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically 
                        describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents 
                        the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.

                    <p>Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the mathematical and conceptual framework for contemporary elementary particle physics. 
                        It is also a framework used in other areas of theoretical physics, such as condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. 
                        In a rather informal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealing with particles, over to fields, i.e. 
                        systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
